    <p>Imagine a world where there is no fear, pain, hunger, and devoid of all negativity.
        Place yourself at the feet of <br>
        peace, nesting on the soft clouds of tranquility, 
        while feasting at the table of fellowship in the comfort of love. <br>
        We challenge ourselves
        to be free and we demand from others nothing more than the respect they expect from <br> 
        us. We find ourselves carving rules in society in the same way that we carve our lovers names
        in our favorite <br>
        trees.</p>

        <h2>Some key takeaways from life's lessons</h2>
        
        <p>I try to remember the most important things my Father taught me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Respect</li>
            <li>Generosity</li>
            <li>Laughter</li>
            <li>Fellowship</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the same breath, I want them to take with them these items from me:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Don't take life too seriously</li>
            <li>Remember to mix fun in with your work</li>
            <li>There is really no difference between friends and family</li>
            <li>Fellowship is the most important thing we can do with each other; it's not just for religion</li>
            <li>Your pursuit of joy and happiness should never end with youth </li>

        </ol>

        <p>Always remember what is important to you and what makes you feel good about yourself!</p>

        <p> As I continue to improve myself in my coding journey, 
          I will never forget to visit resources such as <a href="https://www.w3.org">W3C</a>  <br>
          when I get stuck or need more time to understand where I am going.</p>
